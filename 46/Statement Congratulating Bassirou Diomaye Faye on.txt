I congratulate Bassirou Diomaye Faye on his election as the next President of Senegal. And I send warm wishes to the Senegalese people, who have demonstrated that the right to vote—and have that vote counted—remains democracy's threshold liberty.

Over more than six decades, Senegal and the United States have deepened our partnership, including standing together to counter terrorism, address food insecurity, combat the climate crisis, fight corruption, and ensure that democracy delivers for all of our people. In the years ahead, I look forward to strengthening these ties even further as we continue working together to forge a more peaceful and prosperous future for all.
