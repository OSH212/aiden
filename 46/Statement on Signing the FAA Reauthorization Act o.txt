The bipartisan Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization is a big win for travelers, the aviation workforce, and our economy. It will expand critical protections for air travelers, strengthen safety standards, and support pilots, flight attendants, and air traffic controllers.

It also builds on my administration's efforts to improve the travel experience for airline passengers, affirming the Department of Transportation's rule that mandated automatic refunds when flights are cancelled or significantly delayed. It also makes sure families can sit together without paying extra fees. Passengers shouldn't have to jump through endless hoops just to get the refunds that they are owed, and corporations shouldn't rip off hard-working Americans through hidden junk fees.

I want to thank members of both parties who worked together over many months to pass this long-term reauthorization.
