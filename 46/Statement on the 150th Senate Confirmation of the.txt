One of the greatest responsibilities a President has is the appointment of Federal judges. These judges—confirmed for life—play an integral part in our everyday lives. They oversee cases in which workers fight for safe conditions. They ensure trials are fair and efficient, helping our criminal justice system function. And they issue rulings on fundamental rights, from the right to vote to women's reproductive rights.

Today we reached an important milestone, the confirmation of 150 life-tenured Federal judges since I took office. All of these men and women are highly qualified, faithful to the rule of law, and dedicated to the Constitution. They come from professional backgrounds that have for far too long been underrepresented on the bench, from labor and immigration attorneys to public defenders and civil rights lawyers. And they reflect the diversity that is our country's strength: Two-thirds of those confirmed are women, and nearly two-thirds are people of color.

We have more work to do, and I am committed to filling every judicial vacancy with appointees whose credentials, ability, and impartiality are beyond question. I extend my sincere thanks to Leader Schumer, Chair Durbin, and the Senators on both sides of the aisle who have worked in good faith to help achieve this milestone.
