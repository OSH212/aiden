Jill and I join the people of Chile in grieving the tragic loss of former President Sebastián Piñera of Chile.

Driven by a sense of passion and purpose, President Piñera was committed to forging a more secure and prosperous future for Chile. He worked tirelessly to grow Chile's economy and advocate for his nation on the world stage. During the COVID-19 pandemic, he placed the safety of his fellow citizens paramount, helping Chile achieve one of the fastest vaccination rates in the world. And, in the wake of a devastating earthquake and tsunami in 2010, President Piñera's steadfast leadership not only helped guide Chile through the pain of darkness and loss, but enabled Chile to emerge stronger, an inspiration Chileans can continue to draw from today as they bravely fight and recover from the tragic ongoing wildfires.

I deeply valued my time working with President Piñera over the last decade, where I saw his dedication to his country—and to our partnership—firsthand. The United States will continue the remarkable legacy of cooperation he helped chart, and we send our deepest condolences to former First Lady Cecilia Morel, his family, and all those mourning this grave loss.
