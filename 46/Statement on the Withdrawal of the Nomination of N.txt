Statement on the Withdrawal of the Nomination of Neera Tanden To Be Director of the Office of Management and Budget

I have accepted Neera Tanden's request to withdraw her name from nomination for Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I have the utmost respect for her record of accomplishment, her experience and her counsel, and I look forward to having her serve in a role in my administration. She will bring valuable perspective and insight to our work.
