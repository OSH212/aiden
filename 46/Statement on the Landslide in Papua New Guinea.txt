Jill and I are heartbroken by the loss of life and devastation caused by the landslide in Papua New Guinea. Our prayers are with all the families impacted by this tragedy and all the first responders who are putting themselves in harm's way to help their fellow citizens.

I have directed my administration to stay in close touch with our Papua New Guinean partners as they lead rescue and recovery efforts. We stand ready to assist. And at this dark hour, we will continue to coordinate with Papua New Guinea, Australia, and New Zealand and our Quad partners to ensure we're meeting our commitment to partner in delivering humanitarian assistance and disaster relief across the Indo-Pacific.

The United States stands with Papua New Guinea—our close partner and friend—today and always.
