Remarks to Reporters on the Release From Captivity in Gaza, Palestinian Territories, of United States Citizen Liat Beinin Atzili in Pueblo, Colorado

The President. I've got some very good news to report: Liat Beinin is safe in Egypt. She's crossed the border.

I talked with her mother and father, and they're very appreciative. And things are moving well. She'll soon be home with her three children.

That's all I have to say for right now.

Q. Can you give us a sense of other Americans who might be leaving soon, Mr. President?

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. Thanks, everybody. Thanks, everyone.
