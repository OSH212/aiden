Today's Supreme Court order allows Idaho's extreme abortion ban to go back into effect and denies women critical emergency abortion care required by Federal law. The overturning of Roe v. Wade has enabled Republican elected officials to pursue dangerous abortion bans like this one that continue to jeopardize women's health, force them to travel out of State for care, and make it harder for doctors to provide care, including in an emergency. These bans are also forcing doctors to leave Idaho and other States because of laws that interfere with their ability to care for their patients. This should never happen in America.

The Vice President and I believe that health care decisions should be made by women and their doctors, not politicians. We will continue to defend a woman's ability to access emergency care under Federal law. As this case continues, the stakes could not be higher for women across America. Congress must immediately restore the protections of Roe v. Wade so that women in every State can access the health care they need.
