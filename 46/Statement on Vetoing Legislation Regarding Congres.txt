Statement on Vetoing Legislation Regarding Congressional Disapproval of the Department of Commerce Rule on Procedures Covering Suspension of Liquidation, Duties, and Estimated Duties Related to the Importation of Solar Cells and Modules From Southeast Asia

My "Investing in America" agenda is mobilizing hundreds of billions of dollars in private sector manufacturing and clean energy investments and creating good-paying jobs. When it comes to solar, since I took office, 51 new and expanded solar equipment manufacturing plants have been announced, and America is now on track to increase domestic solar panel manufacturing capacity eight-fold. The fact is, my plan is working.

I vetoed H.J. Res. 39 because we cannot afford to create new uncertainty for American businesses and workers in the solar industry. We can and must strengthen our energy security by maintaining our focus on expanding U.S. capacity that is ready to come on line as this temporary bridge concludes in June 2024.
