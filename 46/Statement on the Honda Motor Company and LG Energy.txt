It's another win for America and another win for Ohio, with Honda and LG committing more than $5 billion toward electric vehicle battery manufacturing and factory retooling across the state. As I said at the groundbreaking of Intel's Ohio factory last month, it's time to bury the label "Rust Belt." Just as my CHIPS and Science Act is spurring record investments in communities across the country, my Inflation Reduction Act is driving a manufacturing boom for electric vehicles. This has been the backbone of my economic plan: America is leading the world again, rebuilding our supply chains, infrastructure, and manufacturing here at home.
