I have always believed in the power of research to save lives and to ensure that Americans get the high-quality health care they need. To achieve scientific breakthroughs and strengthen our ability to prevent, detect, and treat diseases, we have to be bold. That's why today we're establishing a new White House Initiative on Women's Health Research so that my administration—from the National Institutes of Health to the Department of Defense—does everything we can to drive innovation in women's health and close research gaps.
