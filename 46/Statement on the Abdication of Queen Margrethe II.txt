On behalf of the United States, I congratulate Her Majesty Queen Margrethe II of the Kingdom of Denmark as she concludes her tenure and offer thanks for her enduring commitment to deepening the partnership between our two nations. Queen Margrethe's 52-year reign spanned 10 U.S. Presidents, an era during which the Kingdom of Denmark and the United States moved closer together as security and trade partners, while the bonds of friendship between our people grew ever stronger. Queen Margrethe's commitment to her duty, her nation, and all the people of Denmark through the past five decades has set an incredible example of selfless, principled service. The United States congratulates King Frederik X on his succession to the throne and looks forward to continuing our more than 200-year history of partnership and cooperation with the Kingdom of Denmark.
