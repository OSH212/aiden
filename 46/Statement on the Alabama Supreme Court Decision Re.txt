Today, in 2024 in America, women are being turned away from emergency rooms and forced to travel hundreds of miles for health care, while doctors fear prosecution for providing an abortion. And now a court in Alabama put access to some fertility treatments at risk for families who are desperately trying to get pregnant. The disregard for women's ability to make these decisions for themselves and their families is outrageous and unacceptable.

Make no mistake: This is a direct result of the overturning of Roe v. Wade.

I know that folks are worried about what they're seeing happening to women all across America. I am too. I hear about it everywhere I go. My message is, the Vice President and I are fighting for your rights. We're fighting for the freedom of women, for families, and for doctors who care for these women. And we won't stop until we restore the protections of Roe v. Wade in Federal law for all women in every State.
