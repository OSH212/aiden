Today our hearts are heavy. Jill and I are devastated to learn that American Itay Chen was killed by Hamas during its brutal terrorist assault on October 7.

In December, Itay's father and brother joined me at the White House, to share the agony and uncertainty they've faced as they prayed for the safe return of their loved one. No one should have to endure even one day of what they have gone through. At the end of our meeting, they gave me a menorah, a solemn reminder that light will always dispel the darkness and evil will not win.

Today, as we join Itay's parents, brothers, and family in grieving this tragic loss, we keep this reminder close to our hearts. And I reaffirm my pledge to all the families of those still held hostage: We are with you. We will never stop working to bring your loved ones home.
