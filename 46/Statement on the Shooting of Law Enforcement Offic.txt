Earlier today four brave law enforcement officers—including a deputy U.S. marshal—were killed in the line of duty. They are heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice, rushing into harm's way to protect us. We mourn for them and their loved ones. And we pray for the recoveries of the courageous officers who were wounded.

When a law enforcement officer puts on that shield in the morning and heads out the door, their family members dread the phone call, the very call that came today. It's like losing a piece of your soul. To the families of those we lost: Jill and I, and all Americans, are here for you. And we will always be here for you.

We must do more to protect our law enforcement officers. That means funding them so they have the resources they need to do their jobs and keep us safe. And it means taking additional action to combat the scourge of gun violence—now. Leaders in Congress need to step up so that we ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, require safe storage of guns, and pass universal background checks and a national "red flag" law. Enough is enough.

May God Bless these fallen heroes.
