I congratulate Joseph Boakai on his election to be the next President of Liberia. These free and fair elections and Presidential runoff demonstrated Liberians' commitment to making their voices heard through the ballot box, and I look forward to working together to continue deepening the ties between our nations and people in the years ahead.

I also want to commend President Weah for respecting the will of the people, and putting patriotism above politics. As we discussed at the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit last year, the peaceful transition of power is a threshold liberty of democracy. The people of Liberia have exercised their constitutional right and demonstrated the power of that truth. And they have set a clear example for West Africa and the entire world. Democracy is a powerful tool for progress, and democracies can deliver for our people.
