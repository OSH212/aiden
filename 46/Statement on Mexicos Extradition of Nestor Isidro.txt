Today the Mexican Government extradited Nestor Isidro Perez Salaz, known as "El Nini," to the United States to face justice in our courts.

El Nini played a prominent role in the notorious Sinaloa Cartel, one of the deadliest drug trafficking enterprises in the world. The United States has charged him for his role in illicit fentanyl trafficking and for murdering, torturing, and kidnapping numerous rivals, witnesses, and others. This is a good day for justice.

I thank Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador for his decision to extradite this dangerous criminal. Our governments will continue to work together to attack the fentanyl and synthetic drug epidemic that is killing so many people in our homelands and globally and to bring to justice the criminals and organizations producing, smuggling, and selling these lethal poisons in both of our countries.
