If there is one word that defined David Pryor—and the essence of his character—it is integrity.

In serving the people of his beloved Arkansas as a State representative, a U.S. Congressman, a Governor, and a Senator, David always kept his word. He never stopped fighting for working men and women, for the poor, for civil rights. And he was willing to reach across the aisle and do the right thing, even when it cost him politically.

David was my colleague in the Senate for 18 years, and he was my friend. His kindness was always on display: David would drag tables together in the Senate Dining Room to make sure Senators got to know one another on a personal level. Together, we worked to protect Americans from the epidemic of gun violence. David voted for the 1994 assault weapons ban—knowing he'd incur the NRA's wrath—because it would save lives. David and I worked closely together to pass the Violence Against Women Act, which David cosponsored. As chair of the Senate Select Committee on Aging, David fought for America's seniors, standing up against elder abuse and improving nursing home care.

Our country is better off because David Pryor dedicated his life to public service. Today Jill and I are praying for Barbara, David, Scott, former Senator Mark Pryor, and the extended Pryor family.
