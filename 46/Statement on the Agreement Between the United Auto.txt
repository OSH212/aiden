I congratulate the United Auto Workers and Ultium Cells for reaching a historic agreement in Lordstown, Ohio, where UAW workers are manufacturing batteries for General Motors electric cars and trucks. This agreement significantly increases wages and ensures critical health and safety and scheduling protections for 1,600 workers.

Five years ago, the previous administration made false promises to Lordstown workers and then stood by as the community lost jobs and faced economic devastation. Today, Lordstown is a comeback story, and it didn't happen by accident. With the help of my "Investing in America" agenda, the UAW and companies like General Motors are building the future of autos in America while we bring back good paying union jobs to communities like Lordstown. This agreement ensures that these union jobs will continue to be middle class jobs that allow workers to support their families.
