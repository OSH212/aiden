Title: Statement on the Violent Crime Rate

Americans are safer from violent crime today than a year ago. Today an independent organization of police chiefs from the Nation's largest cities released data showing that, compared to a year earlier, violent crime declined across every category in the first quarter of 2024 and murders are down 17 percent. These decreases build on substantial decreases in previous years.

After the prior administration oversaw the largest 1-year increase in murders ever recorded, violent crime is at a near 50-year low. This crime reduction is not an accident. It's the result of extraordinary efforts from law enforcement and community leaders. It's also the result of historic steps by my administration to stop the flow of illegal guns and make the largest ever Federal investment in fighting and preventing crime because of my American Rescue Plan. Despite every Republican in Congress voting against it, that plan passed, and it has enabled cities and States to invest over $15 billion in public safety and violence prevention, putting cops on the beat for accountable community policing as well as interrupting and preventing crime.

We can't stop now. My Safer America Plan calls on Congress to invest $37 billion to support law enforcement and crime prevention, including by funding 100,000 additional police officers for accountable community policing, investing $5 billion in community violence interventions, and enacting commonsense gun safety reforms such as a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and a universal background check requirement.

Make no mistake: America is making progress against crime, saving lives and restoring security and peace of mind. We need that progress to continue. Every family deserves to live in a safe community. I won't stop until they do.
