I congratulate President Bernardo Arévalo de León and Vice President Karin Herrera of Guatemala on their Inauguration. The ties between Guatemala and the United States run deep, and today's Inauguration is a historic testament to our shared commitment to democracy and the will of the people. In the months and years ahead, I look forward to continuing the strong partnership between our nations as we advance human rights, strengthen civilian security, combat corruption, address the root causes of migration, and expand economic opportunity for people across our hemisphere and around the world.
