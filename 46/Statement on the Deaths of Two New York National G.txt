Statement on the Deaths of Two New York National Guardsmen and a United States Border Patrol Agent in a Helicopter Crash Near Rio Grande City, Texas

Yesterday Jill and I learned of the tragic deaths of two National Guardsmen and one U.S. Border Patrol agent whose helicopter crashed while they were conducting routine operations near Rio Grande City, Texas. A third Guardsman was badly injured in the crash and is hospitalized.

These brave Americans dedicated their lives to protecting our Nation. They signed up knowing the risks and believing in the mission of serving their fellow Americans by keeping our nation safe. Our gratitude is profound, and their sacrifice will never be forgotten.

We extend our deepest condolences to their families and loved ones, as well as their colleagues in the National Guard and U.S. Border Patrol. We pray for the injured Guardsman's swift recovery.

As we investigate the circumstances of this crash, we continue to stand with our servicemembers, border agents, and their families, whose contributions to our Nation are vital to our security.
