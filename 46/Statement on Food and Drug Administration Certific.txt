Today is an important milestone in ensuring access to mifepristone, a drug that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as safe and effective for more than 20 years. With major retail pharmacy chains newly certified to dispense medication abortion, many women will soon have the option to pick up their prescription at a local, certified pharmacy, just as they would for any other medication. I encourage all pharmacies that want to pursue this option to seek certification.

The stakes could not be higher for women across America. In the face of relentless attacks on reproductive freedom by Republican elected officials, Vice President Harris and I will continue to fight to ensure that women can get the health care they need, to defend the Food and Drug Administration's independent and evidence-based approval and regulation of mifepristone, and to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade in Federal law.
