Letter to Congressional Leaders on Termination of Emergency With Respect to the Situation in Zimbabwe

Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Madam President:)

Consistent with subsection 204(b) of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(b), I hereby report that I have issued an Executive Order that terminates the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13288 of March 6, 2003, and revokes that order, Executive Order 13391 of November 22, 2005, and Executive Order 13469 of July 25, 2008.

The declaration of a national emergency in Executive Order 13288 with respect to the actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Zimbabwe and other persons to undermine Zimbabwe's democratic processes or institutions, as relied upon for additional steps taken in Executive Order 13391 and as expanded by Executive Order 13469, should no longer be in effect.

Although I continue to be concerned with the situation in Zimbabwe, particularly with respect to acts of violence and other human rights abuses against political opponents and with respect to public corruption, including misuse of public authority, I have determined that the declaration of a national emergency in Executive Order 13288 is no longer needed. Moreover, the United States Government will continue to use existing sanctions authorities to hold accountable persons involved in corruption and serious human rights abuse in Zimbabwe.

Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to terminate the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13288, and revoke that order, Executive Order 13391, and Executive Order 13469.

I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.

Sincerely,



JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.
