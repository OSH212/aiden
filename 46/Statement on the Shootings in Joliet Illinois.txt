Jill and I are praying for the family members of the eight victims killed in Joliet, Illinois, and for the broader community devastated by these tragic shootings.

Federal law enforcement agencies assisted local law enforcement with the investigation.

This tragedy underscores why I am doing everything in my power to keep guns off our streets and out of the hands of those who seek to harm themselves or others. It's why my administration is strengthening the gun background check system and cracking down on gun trafficking through the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. It's why I've taken dozens of executive actions to strengthen gun safety and end the gun violence epidemic. And it's why I continue to call on Congress to pass universal background checks and a national "red flag" law, in addition to other commonsense gun safety measures.

It is within our power to stop the epidemic of gun violence tearing our communities apart. Congress must act now.
