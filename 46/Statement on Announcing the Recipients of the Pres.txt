Statement on Announcing the Recipients of the Presidential Awards for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching and the Presidential Awards for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring

I am deeply appreciative of the inspiration that America's teachers and mentors provide every day to support the next generation of STEM professionals. The dedication these individuals and organizations have demonstrated to prepare students for careers in STEM fields, during what has been a difficult time for teachers, students, and families, plays a huge role in American innovation and competitiveness. The work that teachers and mentors do ensures that our Nation's children are able to unlock—for themselves and all of us—a world of possibilities.
