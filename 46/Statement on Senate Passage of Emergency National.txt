This bipartisan supplemental agreement is critical to advancing America's national security interests. It will allow the United States to continue our vital work, together with our allies and partners all around the world, to stand up for Ukraine's freedom and support its ability to defend itself against Russia's aggression. It will provide Israel with what it needs to protect its people against Hamas terrorists. Significantly, this agreement will provide lifesaving humanitarian assistance for the Palestinian people, the vast majority of whom have nothing to do with Hamas.

I applaud the bipartisan coalition of Senators who came together to advance this agreement, and I urge the House to move on this with urgency. We cannot afford to wait any longer. The costs of inaction are rising every day, especially in Ukraine. Already, we are seeing reports of Ukrainian troops running out of ammunition on the front lines as Russian forces continue to attack and Putin continues to dream of subjugating the Ukrainian people. There are those who say American leadership and our alliances and partnerships with countries around the world do not matter. They do. If we do not stand against tyrants who seek to conquer or carve up their neighbors' territory, the consequences for America's national security will be significant. Our allies and adversaries alike will take note. It is time for the House to take action and send this bipartisan legislation to my desk immediately so that I can sign it into law.
