No woman should be forced to go to court or flee her home State just to receive the health care she needs. But that is exactly what happened in Texas thanks to Republican elected officials, and it is simply outrageous. This should never happen in America, period.

Legal and medical chaos, as we are witnessing in States like Texas, Kentucky, and Arizona, is a direct result of Roe v. Wade being overturned, and as we predicted would happen, women's health and lives now hang in the balance. Republican elected officials have imposed dangerous abortion bans that jeopardize women's health, force them to travel out of State for care, and threaten to criminalize doctors. Their agenda is extreme and out-of-step with the vast majority of Americans.

The Vice President and I will continue to fight to protect access to reproductive health care and to urge Congress to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade now so that women in every State have the right to make their own health care decisions.
