Q. Do you have a message for Iran, sir?

The President. I've already delivered the message to Iran. They know not to do anything.

Q. Will you continue bombing the Houthis if the attacks don't stop, sir?

The President. Say that again.

U.S. Airstrikes in Yemen

Q. Will you continue bombing the Houthis if the attacks don't stop? Will you continue with the strikes, sir?

Q. I'll take a smoothie.

The President. You'll take a smoothie? Well, they're 6 bucks, but I'll do it anyway. [Laughter]

Seriously, if anybody here wants anything, I'll pay for it. Okay?

Co-owner Juan Vargas. That's very generous of you.

The President. And by the way, do we have all the stuff for the firefighters?

Mr. Vargas. Yes, we do, sir.

Co-owner Lauren Vargas. Yes, we do. Pastries and coffee all wrapped up ready to go.

The President. All right.

Mrs. Vargas. Yes.

Employee. We had such a run on business this morning though. They're getting low on supplies probably right now.

Mr. Vargas. We are.

Mrs. Vargas. We actually stopped selling food to the customers this morning so we could send food to the firefighters.

Mr. Vargas. No. We set it aside so that we would have it—[inaudible].

Mrs. Vargas. We did. It's true.

The President. We paid you right?

Mrs. Vargas. Yes, absolutely, absolutely.

Mr. Vargas. Thank you for your generosity.

The President. But I'll be doing—talking with you all after the firefighters.

Q. Thank you.

The President. Thank you.

By the way, we're almost in heaven. We're almost in Scranton.

Mrs. Vargas. Yes.
