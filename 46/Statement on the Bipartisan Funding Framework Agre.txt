The bipartisan funding framework congressional leaders have reached moves us one step closer to preventing a needless Government shutdown and protecting important national priorities. It reflects the funding levels that I negotiated with both parties and signed into law last spring. It rejects deep cuts to programs hard-working families count on and provides a path to passing full-year funding bills that deliver for the American people and are free of any extreme policies. I want to thank Leaders Schumer and Jeffries for their leadership in reaching this framework. Now, congressional Republicans must do their job, stop threatening to shut down the Government, and fulfill their basic responsibility to fund critical domestic and national security priorities, including my supplemental request. It's time for them to act.
