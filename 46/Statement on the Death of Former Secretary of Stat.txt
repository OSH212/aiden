I'll never forget the first time I met Dr. Kissinger. I was a young Senator, and he was Secretary of State, giving a briefing on the state of the world. Throughout our careers, we often disagreed. And often strongly. But from that first briefing, his fierce intellect and profound strategic focus was evident. Long after retiring from Government, he continued to offer his views and ideas to the most important policy discussion across multiple generations. Jill and I send our condolences to his wife Nancy, his children Elizabeth and David, his grandchildren, and all those who loved him.
