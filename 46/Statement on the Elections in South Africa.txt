I congratulate Cyril Ramaphosa on his reelection as President of the Republic of South Africa and commend all the political parties for working together to form a government of national unity.

I also send my warm wishes to the people of South Africa. This year—as South Africa celebrates 30 years of all citizens having the right to vote—they have demonstrated the enduring power of government of the people, by the people, and for the people.

I look forward to the United States and South Africa continuing our work together to expand economic opportunity, invest in clean energy solutions, and demonstrate that democracy delivers.
