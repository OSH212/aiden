We knew Mrs. Marian Robinson as a devoted mother and grandmother with a fierce and unconditional love of her family. With the blessing of friendship, we felt that love ourselves, with every quiet smile or warm embrace she shared with us.

She believed, like we do, that family is the beginning, middle, and end. She moved into the White House to be there for her family when they needed her the most, and in so doing, she served her country right alongside them. Her life is a reminder that we are a great nation because we are a good people.

The entire Biden family sends its deepest love to Michelle, Craig, Barack, Kelly and the six irrepressible grandchildren whom she helped to raise and so loved, and in whom her kind and gentle spirit lives on.

May she rest in peace with her beloved Fraser.

May God bless Mrs. Marian Robinson.
