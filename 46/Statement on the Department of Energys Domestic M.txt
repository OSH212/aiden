As I've said before, under Bidenomics building a clean energy economy can and should provide a win-win opportunity for auto companies and unionized workers who have anchored the American economy for decades. This funding from my "Investing in America" agenda will further that goal by creating auto manufacturing jobs here at home and helping companies avoid painful plant closingsâ€”and to retool, reboot, and rehire in the same factories and communities with high wages. This funding will help existing workers keep their jobs and have the first shot to fill new good jobs as the car industry transforms for future generations.
