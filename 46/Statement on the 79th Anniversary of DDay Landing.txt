Seventy-nine years ago today, American and Allied forces "set upon a mighty endeavor"â€”storming the shores of Normandy and launching the greatest amphibious military operation in history. The brave servicemembers who served on D-Day represent the greatest generation in our history. They stood to oppose the forces of fascism. They volunteered to lay down their lives for our liberty. And together, they answered freedom's call at its hour of greatest need.

Our World War II servicemembers and veterans kept the ultimate faith to our country, and we must always keep our sacred obligation to them, their families, caregivers, and survivors. Today, as we reflect on their service and remember their sacrifice, let us also recommit to the future they fought for, one grounded in freedom, democracy, equality, and opportunity for all.
