When I passed the bipartisan infrastructure law, I knew I needed someone by my side who would help deliver real results for the American people. I knew that Mitch Landrieu, a former mayor and Lieutenant Governor who spent over a decade helping rebuild New Orleans, was the man to help me rebuild the country. Mitch has always known that the real measure of success is not about scoring partisan points, it's about building bridges and fixing the problem at hand.

As my Senior Adviser, Mitch has helped oversee the most transformational investment in American infrastructure in generations. In 2 years, our administration has announced over 40,000 infrastructure projects spread across 4,500 communities in every State, Territory, and Washington, DC. We've expanded affordable high-speed internet access to over 22 million people and started improvements on over 135,000 miles of roads in America.

Mitch has traveled over 119,000 miles to nearly 150 cities across the country to hear directly from communities and partner with Governors, mayors, Members of Congress, labor, and private sector companies to help rebuild America. Mitch has consistently demonstrated that when we work together, we can do big things.

I offer my deepest gratitude to Mitch for his leadership and for his decades of service to the American people. I will miss his counsel greatly.

I also want to thank his wife Cheryl, his children Grace, Emily, Matthew, Benjamin, and William, and his mother Verna for sharing him with us.
