I congratulate Turkey, Finland, and Sweden on signing a trilateral memorandum, which paves the way for allies to invite Finland and Sweden to join NATO at the Madrid summit. When I welcomed President Niinist√∂ and Prime Minister Andersson to the White House last month, I told them that the United States strongly supports their membership. Finland and Sweden are strong democracies with highly capable militaries. Their membership will strengthen NATO's collective security and benefit the entire transatlantic alliance. I look forward to working with NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg, our allies, and with Congress to ensure that we can quickly welcome them into our alliance. As we begin this historic NATO summit in Madrid, our alliance is stronger, more united and more resolute than ever.
