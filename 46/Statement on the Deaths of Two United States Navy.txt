Jill and I are mourning the tragic deaths of two of America's finest: Navy SEALs who were lost at sea while executing a mission off the coast of East Africa last week. Over 10 days, the United States military conducted an extensive search-and-rescue mission. Recovery efforts are still continuing as we grieve this profound loss for our country. These SEALs represented the very best of our country, pledging their lives to protect their fellow Americans. Our hearts go out to the family members, loved ones, friends, and shipmates who are grieving for these two brave Americans. Our entire country stands with you. We will never fail to honor their service, their legacy, and their sacrifice.
