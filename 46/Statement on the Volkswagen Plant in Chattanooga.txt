I congratulate the Volkswagen autoworkers in Chattanooga who filed for a union election with the UAW. As one of the world's largest automakers, many Volkswagen plants internationally are unionized. As the most pro-union President in American history, I believe American workers, too, should have a voice at work. The decision whether to join a union belongs to the workers.
