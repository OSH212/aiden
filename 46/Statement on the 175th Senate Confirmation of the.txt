During the past 3 years, I have worked tirelessly to nominate men and women to the Federal bench who are committed to the rule of law. Today we reached an important milestone: the confirmation of the 175th life-tenured Federal judge since I took office. I am grateful to Leader Schumer, Chair Durbin, and Senators on both sides of the aisle who have helped to make today's milestone a reality.

I'm particularly proud that these judges reflect the diversity that is our country's strength. They come from every corner of the legal profession. They were prosecutors, defense attorneys, civil rights lawyers, and advocates for women's reproductive freedoms. They were labor lawyers, municipal law experts, and academics. More than 65 percent are women, and 65 percent are people of color. And we have confirmed more Black women to life-tenured Federal judgeships than any previous administration in history—including our Nation's first Black woman on the U.S. Supreme Court, Ketanji Brown Jackson.

Judges make decisions on issues that matter to the American people, from workers' rights to women's reproductive rights, to making sure our criminal justice system functions fairly and efficiently. That is why I will continue moving expeditiously—working with the Senate—to nominate and confirm exceptionally qualified individuals who are impartial and faithful to the Constitution.
