Statement on the Appointment of Former Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez as Senior Adviser and Director of the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs

I am pleased to announce that Tom Perez will be serving as Senior Advisor, Assistant to the President, and Director of Intergovernmental Affairs.

Tom will build on the tremendous work of Julie Ch√°vez Rodriguez. He brings decades of experience to my team, having served in local, State, and Federal Government. His perspective and relationships as a former county councilman, a top civil rights attorney, and Secretary of Labor will be invaluable as we implement our "Invest in America" agenda and continue to make our Government work for the people and for communities across the country.

I've known Tom for years, and I look forward to working together again.
