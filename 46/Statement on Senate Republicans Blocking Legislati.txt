Once again, Senate Republicans refused to protect access to fertility treatments for women who are desperately trying to get pregnant. And just last week, Senate Republicans blocked nationwide protections for birth control. The disregard for a woman's right to make these decisions for herself and her family is outrageous and unacceptable.

Republican officials have had every opportunity to protect reproductive freedom since the Supreme Court's extreme decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, but they refuse to do so. Instead, Republicans' dangerous, out-of-touch agenda is devastating women's health and lives.

Vice President Harris and I believe that every woman should have the right to access the care they need, including fertility treatment, without interference from politicians. This is a basic issue of reproductive freedom, and we will continue fighting, alongside Democrats in Congress, until we restore the protections of Roe v. Wade in Federal law for all women in every state.
