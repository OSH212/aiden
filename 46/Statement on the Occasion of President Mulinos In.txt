I congratulate President José Raúl Mulino of Panama on his inauguration. The ties between Panama and the United States are long-standing and deep, based on our shared democratic values. I look forward to continuing our strong bilateral partnership as we work together to promote good governance, advance inclusive economic growth, and address irregular migration. We are ready to support Panama as it delivers a more prosperous, secure future for all Panamanians.
