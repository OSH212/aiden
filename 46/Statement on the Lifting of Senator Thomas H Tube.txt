After 10 months of undermining military readiness and the morale of our troops, Senator Tuberville of Alabama has finally lifted his politically motivated hold on hundreds of military nominations. Four hundred twenty-five highly qualified, patriotic military leaders have now been confirmed by the Senate to perform their duties as they fulfill their sacred oath to keep our country safe. These confirmations are long overdue and should never have been held up in the first place. Our servicemembers are the backbone of our country and deserve to receive the pay and promotions they have earned. In the end, this was all pointless. Senator Tuberville, and the Republicans who stood with him, needlessly hurt hundreds of servicemembers and military families and threatened our national security, all to push a partisan agenda. I hope no one forgets what he did.

Those who serve this Nation deserve better. Thankfully, military leaders will finally be able to take their next post. Military families who for months have been in limbo will finally be able to make plans to move, start new jobs, and enter new schools. Our servicemembers and military families put everything on the line for our country. I thank the Senate for quickly confirming these appointments and urge them to confirm the remaining appointees swiftly.
