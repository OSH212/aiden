To those who doubted that America could dominate the industries of the future, I say this: You should never bet against the American people. Today is another win for America, and another massive new investment in America spurred by my economic plan. Micron, an American company, is investing $20 billion dollars this decade and up to $100 billion over 20 years in chips manufacturing in Upstate New York, creating tens of thousands of good-paying jobs. Together, we are building an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, where we lower costs for our families and make it right here in America.
