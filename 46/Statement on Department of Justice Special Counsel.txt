The Special Counsel released today its findings about its look into my handling of classified documents. I was pleased to see they reached the conclusion I believed all along they would reach: that there would be no charges brought in this case and the matter is now closed.

This was an exhaustive investigation going back more than 40 years, even into the 1970s when I was a young Senator. I cooperated completely, threw up no roadblocks, and sought no delays. In fact, I was so determined to give the Special Counsel what they needed that I went forward with 5 hours of in-person interviews over 2 days on October 8 and 9 of last year, even though Israel had just been attacked on October 7 and I was in the middle of handling an international crisis. I just believed that's what I owed the American people so they could know no charges would be brought and the matter closed.

Over my career in public service, I have always worked to protect America's security. I take these issues seriously, and no one has ever questioned that.
