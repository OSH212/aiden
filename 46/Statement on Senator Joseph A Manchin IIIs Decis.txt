For more than 40 years—as a State legislator, a secretary of state, a Governor, and a Senator—Joe Manchin has dedicated himself to serving the people of his beloved West Virginia. During my time as Vice President and now as President, Joe and I have worked together to get things done for hard-working families. From the bipartisan infrastructure law, which is upgrading America's aging infrastructure, to the PACT Act, which is making sure our veterans get the care they deserve, to the Inflation Reduction Act, which is strengthening our energy security and lowering prescription drug costs for our seniors, to the most meaningful gun safety legislation in three decades, we've made real progress. I was also proud when Joe voted to make history and confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson as the first Black woman to serve on the United States Supreme Court.

Joe, Gayle, and the entire Manchin family should feel proud of the Senator's service to West Virginia and to our country. I look forward to continuing our work together to get things done for the American people.
