Statement on Senate Confirmation of Philip N. Jefferson as Vice Chair and Lisa D. Cook and Adriana D. Kugler as Members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System

I applaud the Senate for confirming my superbly qualified nominees to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors on a bipartisan basis. In the past year, inflation has come down by around two-thirds, while the job market has remained historically strong, and I am confident that Dr. Jefferson, Dr. Cook, and Dr. Kugler will help continue this progress. My administration remains laser focused on bringing costs down for families while maintaining the world-beating economic growth that America has experienced in the last 2-plus years.

With the confirmation of these outstanding economists to the Federal Reserve, the American people can be confident that the Fed's important mission remains in good hands, and it will continue working for them, not any partisan agenda.
