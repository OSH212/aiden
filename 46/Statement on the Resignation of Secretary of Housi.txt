A fair housing market and access to quality and affordable housing are critical to the fulfillment of the American dream, and no one understands that better than Secretary Marcia L. Fudge. When I took office, we inherited a broken housing system, with fair housing and civil rights protections badly dismantled under the prior administration. On day one, Marcia got to work rebuilding the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and over the past 3 years, she has been a strong voice for expanding efforts to build generational wealth through homeownership and lowering costs and promoting fairness for America's renters.

Under Marcia's transformational leadership, we have worked hard to lower housing costs and increase supply. We've proposed the largest investment in affordable housing in U.S. history. We've taken steps to aggressively combat racial discrimination in housing by ensuring home appraisals are more fair and by strengthening programs to redress the negative impacts of redlining. Thanks to Secretary Fudge, we've helped first-time home buyers, and we are working to cut the cost of renting. And there are more housing units under construction right now than at any time in the last 50 years.

From her time as a mayor, to her years as a fierce advocate in the U.S. House of Representatives, Marcia's vision, passion, and focus on increasing economic opportunity have been assets to our country. I'm grateful for all of her contributions toward a housing system that works for all Americans, and I wish her well in her next chapter.
