Jill and I are deeply saddened by the loss of life and devastation caused by the flooding in Brazil. Our thoughts and prayers are with the people impacted by this tragedy and the first responders working to rescue and provide medical care to families and individuals. My administration is in contact with our Brazilian partners, and the United States is working to provide necessary assistance to the Brazilian people, in coordination with Brazilian authorities as they lead the response. The United States stands with Brazil at this difficult time.
