Jill and I were horrified to learn that three college students of Palestinian descent, two of whom are American citizens, were shot Saturday in Burlington, Vermont. They were simply spending Thanksgiving gathered with family and loved ones.

We join Americans across the country in praying for their full recovery, and we send our deepest condolences to their families. While we are waiting for more facts, we know this: There is absolutely no place for violence or hate in America. Period. No person should worry about being shot at while going about their daily lives. And far too many Americans know a family member injured or killed as a result of gun violence. We cannot and we will not accept that.

Earlier today I spoke to Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger to offer my support. We are grateful to the Burlington Police Department—as well as the FBI, ATF, and other law enforcement partners—for their swift work identifying and arresting a suspect. Our administration will provide any additional Federal resources needed to assist in the investigation.
