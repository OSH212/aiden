Congratulations to members of the United Steelworkers and to Blue Bird for proving once again that meeting our clean energy goals is an opportunity to create good-paying union jobs for American workers. Last year, I was excited to meet with Delushundra "Dee" Thomas, who helped organize these workers. Their new contract is a lifechanging agreement that includes raises, retirement, and profit-sharing for 1,500 Georgians.

When I think about climate, I think about jobs: good-paying, union jobs. My "Investing in America" agenda provided the grants that are helping put Georgians to work building these electric schoolbuses. I'm grateful to Secretary Su for working alongside the United Steelworkers and Blue Bird in their collective bargaining process to make sure their contract creates good, union jobs and helps workers and the company thrive.

When we invest in American workers, we all win. Congratulations to the steelworkers at Blue Bird, whose new contract will improve the lives of over 1,500 Georgians for years to come.
