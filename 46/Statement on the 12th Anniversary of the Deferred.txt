Twelve years ago today, President Obama and I announced the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program to allow our young people to live and work in the only country they've called home. Since then, DACA has provided more than 800,000 "Dreamers" with the ability to work lawfully, pursue an education, open businesses, and contribute their enormous talents to make our communities better and stronger.

I'm proud of the contributions of Dreamers to our country, and I am committed to providing Dreamers the support they need to succeed. That's why I directed the Department of Homeland Security to take all appropriate actions to "preserve and fortify" DACA, and that's why we continue to vigorously defend the DACA rule in court. That's also why last month, the Department of Health and Human Services took the historic step of expanding access to affordable, quality health coverage to DACA recipients through the Affordable Care Act.

On day one of my administration, I sent a comprehensive immigration reform plan to Congress to protect Dreamers and their families. While Vice President Harris and I will continue fighting for our Dreamers, only Congress can provide permanent and lasting stability for them and their families. Congress must still act.
