Statement on the Death of Two Mississippi National Guardsmen in a Helicopter Crash in Booneville, Mississippi

Jill and I mourn the loss of two Mississippi National Guardsmen, whose aircraft crashed during a routine training mission near Booneville, Mississippi, yesterday.

Our prayers are with their families, units, and the entire Mississippi National Guard at this incredibly difficult time. These two Guardsmen embodied the very best of our Nation, bound by honor, and committed to service. We will continue to keep our solemn promise to care for their families, just as they were faithful to our Nation.

I am grateful to the local law enforcement and first responders, who quickly supported recovery efforts after this tragic accident. As the Department of Defense and National Guard continue to assess what occurred, we stand ready to provide any assistance needed.
