I welcome the announcement that NATO will extend Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg's term for an additional year. With his steady leadership, experience, and judgement, Secretary General Stoltenberg has brought our alliance through the most significant challenges in European security since World War II. Today, our alliance is stronger, more united and purposeful than it has ever been. I look forward to continuing the work with Secretary General Stoltenberg to further strengthen the alliance next week at the NATO summit in Vilnius and ahead of the 75th anniversary NATO summit in Washington, DC, next year.
