Less than a week ago, Iran launched one of the largest missile and drone attacks the world has ever seen against Israel. Together with our allies and partners, the United States defended Israel. We helped defeat this attack. And today we are holding Iran accountable, imposing new sanctions and export controls on Iran.

The sanctions target leaders and entities connected to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Iran's Defense Ministry, and the Iranian Government's missile and drone program that enabled this brazen assault. As I discussed with my fellow G-7 leaders the morning after the attack, we are committed to acting collectively to increase economic pressure on Iran. And our allies and partners have or will issue additional sanctions and measures to restrict Iran's destabilizing military programs.

During my administration, the United States has sanctioned over 600 individuals and entities, including Iran and its proxies, Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and Kataib Hezbollah. And we will keep at it. I've directed my team, including the Department of the Treasury, to continue to impose sanctions that further degrade Iran's military industries.

Let it be clear to all those who enable or support Iran's attacks: The United States is committed to Israel's security. We are committed to the security of our personnel and partners in the region. And we will not hesitate to take all necessary action to hold you accountable.
