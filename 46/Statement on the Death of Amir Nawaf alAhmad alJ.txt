Jill and I were saddened to learn of the passing of His Highness Amir Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmed al-Jaber al-Sabah, the Amir of Kuwait. Sheikh Nawaf was a valued partner and true friend of the United States throughout his decades of service. I offer my condolences to Sheikh Nawaf's family and the people of Kuwait on behalf of the United States of America and the American people. Today we mourn his passing and we honor his life and the vision we shared for greater peace and stability across the Middle East. We will continue to strengthen the longstanding ties between the governments and people of the United States and Kuwait as we pursue that future together.
