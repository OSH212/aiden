Jill and I are heartbroken at the loss of five U.S. marines, whose aircraft crashed while flying from Nevada to California during a routine training mission. As the Department of Defense continues to assess what occurred, we extend our deepest condolences to their families, their squadron, and the U.S. Marine Corps as we grieve the loss of five of our Nation's finest warriors. I am deeply grateful to the San Diego County Sheriff's Department, the U.S. Air Force Auxiliary-Civil Air Patrol, and other Federal, State, and local agencies for their professionalism and dedication in supporting search-and-recovery efforts.

Our servicemembers represent the very best of our Nation, and these five marines were no exception. Today, as we mourn this profound loss, we honor their selfless service and ultimate sacrifice and reaffirm the sacred obligation we bear to all those who wear the uniform and their families.
