I am disappointed in today's Fifth Circuit decision holding that DACA is unlawful. The court's stay provides a temporary reprieve for DACA recipients, but one thing remains clear: the lives of "Dreamers" remain in limbo. Today's decision is the result of continued efforts by Republican State officials to strip DACA recipients of the protections and work authorization that many have now held for over a decade. And while we will use the tools we have to allow "Dreamers" to live and work in the only country they know as home, it is long past time for Congress to pass permanent protections for "Dreamers," including a pathway to citizenship.

My administration is committed to defending "Dreamers" against attacks from Republican officials in Texas and other States. This challenge to DACA is just another example of the extreme agenda being pushed by MAGA-Republican officials.
