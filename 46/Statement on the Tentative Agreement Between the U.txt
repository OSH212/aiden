Statement on the Tentative Agreement Between the United Auto Workers and Daimler Truck North America LLC

I applaud the UAW and Daimler for reaching a tentative agreement for a record contract. The UAW workers at Daimler are building the trucks and school buses of the future right here in America.

My Investing in America agenda will continue to create good jobs. This agreement is a testament to the power of collective bargaining and shows that we can build a clean energy economy with strong, middle class union jobs.
