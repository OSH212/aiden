Today I am righting an historic wrong by using my clemency authority to pardon many former servicemembers who were convicted simply for being themselves. Our Nation's servicemembers stand on the frontlines of freedom and risk their lives in order to defend our country. Despite their courage and great sacrifice, thousands of LGBTQI+ servicemembers were forced out of the military because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Some of these patriotic Americans were subject to court-martial and have carried the burden of this great injustice for decades.

As Commander in Chief, I am committed to maintaining the finest fighting force in the world. That means making sure that every member of our military is safe and respected so they can focus on their mission.

This is about dignity, decency, and ensuring the culture of our Armed Forces reflect the values that make us an exceptional nation. We have a sacred obligation to all of our servicemembers, including our brave LGBTQI+ servicemembers: to properly prepare and equip them when they are sent into harm's way and to care for them and their families when they return home. Today we are making progress in that pursuit.
