Jill and I were horrified to learn of the brutal attack carried out in Rockford last night, which took the lives of four people, including one 15-year-old. Seven others were tragically wounded as a result of this senseless violence. We are praying for the families of those who lost loved ones and hoping that all those injured make a full recovery. We are also grateful for the heroic actions of local law enforcement, who confronted the suspect and prevented the loss of more innocent life.

Federal law enforcement have offered all available assistance to local law enforcement as they investigate this heinous act. In the meantime, my administration will do everything in its power to help the people of Rockford and the broader community recover from this traumatic event.

Families across America want the same thing: the freedom to feel safe in their community. That is my priority and the reason we've made major investments to provide communities with resources and law enforcement officers to prevent and fight crime. This tragic event is a reminder that we must continue to ensure that our police and first responders have the support they need to do their jobs and keep us safe.
