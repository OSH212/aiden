Yesterday's extreme decision puts desperately needed medical care even further out of reach for millions of women in Florida and across the South. The court not only upheld Florida's current ban on women being able to make their own reproductive choices, it will likely trigger Governor DeSantis' even more extreme law that would prevent women from accessing care before many even know they are pregnant. It is outrageous.

Florida's bans—like those put forward by Republican elected officials across the country—are putting the health and lives of millions of women at risk. These extreme laws take away women's freedom to make their own health care decisions and threaten physicians with jail time simply for providing the medical care that they were trained to provide.

Vice President Harris and I stand with the vast majority of Americans who support a woman's right to choose, including in Florida, where voters will have the opportunity to make their voices heard in support of a reproductive freedom ballot initiative this November. We remain steadfast in our commitment to protecting reproductive freedom in Florida and across the Nation and will continue to call on Congress to pass a law restoring the protections of Roe v. Wade in every State.
