Statement on the Candidacy of Sarah H. Cleveland To Be a Judge on the International Court of Justice

I strongly support Professor Sarah Cleveland's candidacy to serve on the International Court of Justice, the main judicial organ of the United Nations. A talented scholar and practitioner of international law, Cleveland is committed to the principles that have long been at the heart of the Court: judicial independence, rigor, and humanity.

As we face a range of pressing global challenges, the court's work has never been more important. Cleveland's experience as a professor, government adviser, and expert on multilateral bodies—and her deep respect for the diversity of the world's legal systems—underscore her ability to make valuable contributions to the issues that come before the court at this critical moment.

That is why I am proud to call on all U.N. member states to join the United States in voting for Sarah Cleveland to serve as judge on the International Court of Justice, which remains one of humanity's most critical institutions to advance peace around the world.
