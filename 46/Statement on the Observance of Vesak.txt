Jill and I extend warm wishes to Buddhists in the United States and around the world as they celebrate Vesak. As we honor the birth, passing, and enlightenment of Buddha, we recognize the American Buddhists who contribute so much to our communities and our country. For over 2,500 years, those who adhere to the Buddha's teachings have enriched and strengthened this world we share. Vesak is a time to reflect on the Buddha's teachings, including the need to work for peace and justice and cultivate humility and compassion as we work together towards a brighter future.
