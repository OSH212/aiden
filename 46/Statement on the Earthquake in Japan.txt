Jill and I are praying for the people of Japan who have been impacted by the terrible earthquake. My administration is in touch with Japanese officials, and the United States stands ready to provide any necessary assistance for the Japanese people. As close allies, the United States and Japan share a deep bond of friendship that unites our people. Our thoughts are with the Japanese people during this difficult time.
