Health care should be a right—not a privilege—for all Americans. Today, with the beginning of the open enrollment period on healthcare.gov, we can continue delivering on that fundamental promise.

Starting today and running through January 15, 2024, Americans across the country can gain the peace of mind that comes from having quality, affordable health coverage. Signing up is easy; simply go to healthcare.gov, and select the plan that works best for you and your family.

Last year, over 16 million people signed up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, more Americans than ever before. Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, coverage on healthcare.gov and the State-based marketplaces continues to be more affordable and accessible than ever, with consumers saving an average of $800 on their premiums annually. In fact, four in five customers can find quality coverage for less than $10 a month. If you don't receive insurance through your employer, there are a range of quality, affordable coverage options available to you.

We've made record-breaking progress in expanding coverage and lowering health care costs for American families, saving them money and giving more Americans the peace of mind that comes with affordable health insurance. I urge everyone to visit healthcare.gov today to renew their coverage or shop for a plan.
