Today, the Iowa Supreme Court ruled that the state's extreme and dangerous abortion ban can go into effect. Iowa is the twenty-second state with an abortion ban, imposed by Republican elected officials, that puts women's health and lives in jeopardy.

This should never happen in America. Yet, this is exactly what is happening in states across the country since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. And it's not stopping at the state level - Republican elected officials in Congress have proposed four national abortion bans while refusing to protect nationwide access to IVF and contraception.

Vice President Harris and I believe that women in every state must have the right to make deeply personal decisions about their health. We will continue to call on Congress to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade in federal law and stand firm against efforts made by Republican elected officials to undermine Americans' fundamental freedoms.
