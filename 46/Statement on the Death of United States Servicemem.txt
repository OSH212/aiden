Today Jill and I mourn the loss of five American servicemembers who died when their aircraft crashed in the Mediterranean Sea during a routine training mission. Our servicemembers put their lives on the line for our country every day. They willingly take risks to keep the American people safe and secure. And their daily bravery and selflessness is an enduring testament to what is best in our Nation.

Jill and I are praying for the families and friends who have lost a precious loved one, a piece of their soul. Our entire nation shares their grief. And, during this weekend when we pause to honor our Nation's veterans, we once more affirm the sacred obligation we bear to those who volunteer to serve our Nation as well as their families, caregivers, and survivors. We pray for the families of all our fallen warriors today and every day.
